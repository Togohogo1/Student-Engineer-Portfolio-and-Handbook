## What to Expect [ꜛ](#table-of-contents)
---
---
\
This handbook contains over 15 tools, models, and frameworks (TMFs) that I have used. Consequently, these tools are selected based on my positionality and most of them have proven to work, and will likely continue reinforcing my engineering journey ahead.

The following TMFs will be listed in a somewhat logical order to use them, each accompanied by a sufficient description and usage examples.

## Definitions [ꜛ](#table-of-contents)

## Foundational Concepts [ꜛ](#table-of-contents)
---
---
\
This section contains various TMFs that sets up the prior knowledge that is useful for Framing, Diverging, Converging, and Representing (FDCR). The next sections give a more detailed breakdown of FDCR but for now, it suffices to know that it is a way to model engineering design that naturally repeats itself.

### The Perry Model of Intellectual and Ethical Development [ꜛ](#table-of-contents)
---
\
The Perry Model is a representation of attitudes one can experience when embarking on an engineering journey. To gain a better understanding, consider the following terms:
1. **A**uthority: Emphasis on the capital **A**, relates to making decisions based on consultations with someone knowledgeable.
2. **a**uthority: Emphasis on the lowercase **a**, relates to the recognition that one can make their own decisions with the facility of a higher **A**uthority.

For student engineers, the goal of the Perry Model is to show the possibility of transitioning from Authority to authority.

![Perry Model](https://togohogo1.github.io/Student-Engineer-Portfolio-and-Handbook/assets/handbook/Aa.png)

<sup><i>Figure 1.</i> Visual representation adaptation of the Perry Model taken from <a href="">[1]</a></sup>

#### Dualism to Multiplicity [[2]](https://uthsc.edu/tlc/intellectual-ethical-development.php)
First:
- The acceptance that there is only right and wrong (represented by black and white)
- Authority figures hold the answers where one accepts as true

Then:
- Nuances do exist, not everything is certain
- Can be frustrating at times if accustomed to dual thinking
- Multiple interpretations start to create puzzlement

#### Relativism to Commitmtnet [[2]](https://uthsc.edu/tlc/intellectual-ethical-development.php)
After:
- Recognition of multiple perspectives, answers, approaches
- Authority figures do not always have the right answer
- Learn how to back up one's interpretation with evidence

Finally:
- Learn how to make one's own informed decisions
- Recognize free choice becomes available
- One validates other perspectives (represented by colours)
- Accepts the uncertainties of the world

#### Personal Experience
The Perry Model stood out to me during a RFP rescoping session. I was too reliant on the input of a stakeholder, putting them in a position of **A**uthority. A course instructor reminded me about my role as a student engineer, and I had the choice to make an informed engineering decision, giving me the **a**uthority to move forward with my planned rescoping.

#### When to Use
The Perry Model is not physically used, but rather a thought process that helps guide engineering thinking to realize the complexities of the world and the self.

### Perceive Interpret Assess Act (PIAA) [ꜛ](#table-of-contents)
---
\
The PIAA model is a way of thinking that allows one to reflect on their perceptions to reduce the likelihood of making an impulse decision.

![Perceive Interpret Assess Act](https://togohogo1.github.io/Student-Engineer-Portfolio-and-Handbook/assets/handbook/piaa.png)

<sup><i>Figure 2.</i> Visual representation adaptation of the PIAA model taken from <a href="">[4]</a></sup>

#### Components
There are 4 components of the PIAA model:
1. **Perceive**: Comes from the five senses
2. **Interpret**: Process the multisensory information and reflect on the meaning
3. **Assess**: Choose a meaning that best suits the situation and gives a desireable outcome for the perceiver
4. **Act**: Not taken on impulse, but after careful consideration

#### My Experiences
PIAA is used during Praxis II stakeholder interactions. For the TTL RFP, my team needed to find an engineering opportunity. We also wanted to avoid being disrespectful or sound dismissive to stakeholders when asking questions after making observation.

#### When to Use
Anywhere. Engineering is full of instances where decisions need to be made. The goal is to make informed decisions rather than impulse decisions.

### Toulmin's Structure of Argument [ꜛ](#table-of-contents)
---
\
This tool allows one to craft structurally sound arguments. It makes sure arguments are backed up by sufficient evidence and are as irrefutable as possible.

![Toulmin's Structure of Argument](https://togohogo1.github.io/Student-Engineer-Portfolio-and-Handbook/assets/handbook/toulmin.png)

<sup><i>Figure 3.</i> Visual representation adaptation if Toulmin's Structure of Argument taken from <a href="">[6]</a></sup>

#### Components [[5]]()
Commonly, Toulmin's model includes:
<table>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Ground</b></td>
        <td>An observation to base the claim on, resting on data or facts.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Claim</b></td>
        <td>An interpretation made with respect to the ground that one wants another to believe. There are different types of claims (outlines in next subsection).</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Justification</b></td>
        <td>A coherent and logical explanation to back up the claim.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Evidence</b></td>
        <td>Supports for the claim backed up by factual data.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Qualifier</b></td>
        <td>Constrains the argument to a limit of certainty.</td>
    </tr>
</table>
And sometimes also:
<table>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Counterclaim</b></td>
        <td>Refutations against the claim that can sometimes explose its weaknesses. This is why a qualifier is important.</td>
    </tr>
</table>

#### Claims in More Detail
Claims come in a wide spectrum, only three types are useful for discussion:
1. **Analytical claims**: Claims that sit closest to the ground, requires the least amount of evidence and justification
2. **Interpretive claims**: Claims that sit a bit further from the ground
3. **Speculative claims**: Claims that require a lot of evidence and justification, but not a completely bogus claim.

Interpretive claims and speculative claims may also be helpful in ideal generation.

#### When to Use
Toulmin's model should be used every time one has to make a claim, like the PIAA model, is a frequent occurence in engineering.

### The CRAAP test [ꜛ](#table-of-contents)
---
\
The CRAAP test is used to evalute the credibility of secondary research. That is, research not conducted through testing, modelling, and experimentation.

#### Components [[7]](https://library.csuchico.edu/sites/default/files/craap-test.pdf)
CRAAP is an acronym, which makes the test easy to memory and apply:
<table>
    <tr>
        <td><b>C</b>urrency</td>
        <td>
            <ul>
            <li>The timeliness of the information</li>
            <li>Pay attention to publish date and last update date</li>
            </ul>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>R</b>elevance</td>
        <td>
            <ul>
            <li>How applicable is the information to the purpose?</li>
            <li>Consider the target audience</li>
            <li>Consider the level its written for</li>
            </ul>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>A</b>uthority</td>
        <td>
            <ul>
            <li>Who created/contributed to creating the source?</li>
            <li>What organizations are they affiliated with?</li>
            <li>(Websites) Can the domain be trusted?</li>
            </ul>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>A</b>ccuracy</td>
        <td>
            <ul>
            <li>Question where the information comes from</li>
            <li>Is the information backed up by evidence?</li>
            <li>How rigorous are the verification protocols?</li>
            <li>Has the source been peer reviewed?</li>
            </ul>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>P</b>urpose</td>
        <td>
            <ul>
            <li>Question why this information exists</li>
            <li>Pay attention to language for any prejudice, emotions, or bias</li>
            </ul>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

#### Example
When trying to find research on safe horizontal pushing force limits for Praxis II, I made use of the CRAAP test to evaluate the following source:

![CRAAP Test](https://togohogo1.github.io/Student-Engineer-Portfolio-and-Handbook/assets/handbook/craap.png)

<sup><i>Figure 4.</i> A source extract from the Handbook of HUman Factors. The source by Weston, Alizadeh, et al. can be found <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29241415/">here</a></sup>

Running it through the CRAAP test shows that it can be trusted.

<table>
    <tr>
        <td><b>C</b>urrency</td>
        <td>
        The 5th edition of this Handbook was published in 2021. The source by Weston, Alizadeh, et al. was published late 2017.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>R</b>elevance</td>
        <td>
        As I was trying to determine safe horizontal pushing force limits for heavy objects, this was very relevant to my goal.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>A</b>uthority</td>
        <td>
        The authors both attained PhDs and hold distinguished positions at the University of Central Florida and roles away from academia. Their engineering backgrounds also make them good candidates to trust. Wiley is a renowned publishing company.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>A</b>ccuracy</td>
        <td>
        The information the authors select is taken from trusted journal articles. The excerpt taken from Weston, Alizadeh, et al. has over 20 citations and is published on the National Center for Biotechnology Information.
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>P</b>urpose</td>
        <td>
        The purpose of the ergonomics handbook is clearly defined, and the extract was relevant to the section I was concerned with (22.7.3).
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

## Framing [ꜛ](#table-of-contents)
---
---
\
The first component of the FDCR model, Framing is concerned with defining an opportunity based on questioning personal perceptions of the world, which are influenced by their people's experiences and values.

The beginning of framing is involved with scoping - what one considers when defining an opportunity. There are aspects that one could scope out (not consider) and scope in (consider in greater detail). Naturally, each person has a different lens that they look through, giving rise to multiple perspectives.

![Scoping](https://togohogo1.github.io/Student-Engineer-Portfolio-and-Handbook/assets/handbook/scoping.png)

<sub><i>Figure 5.</i> Representation of scoping showing how two people can look at the same image and come up with different interpretations. Image retrieved from: <a href="https://www.umcontario.com/about">https://www.umcontario.com/about.</a></sub>

Multiple rounds of scoping is known as rescoping, which usually happens when new information about the opportunity is obtained or the current scope is not at a suitable scale.

Scoping paves the way for one of the most important TMFs in engineering design - The Requirements Model.

### The Requirements Model [ꜛ](#table-of-contents)
---
\
In engineering documents where The Requirements Model is needed, requirements define specifications that a solution addressing an engineering opportunity should need.

#### Components
The Requirements Model consits of various requirement strings (sometimes shortened as requirements) that contain the following: [[8]]()
- **Objectives**: To capture the intention of the design by defining something the design should be or do. Objectives can be broken down into high-level and low-level
    - **High-level objectives**: A very general objective that allows more flexibility in what a design should be or do.
    - **Low-level objectives**: Specifies a high-level objective to narrow down on what a design should be or do, preferably in a way such that it can be quantified.
- **Metrics**: The way that the objective is measured
- **Constraints**: Based on metrics, defines boundaries that the design must not violate. [[6]]() A design is viable if it meets the constraints. Can be defined with tolerances or hard limits.
- **Criteria**: Defines the relationships between measurements. [[6]]() Qualifies the viability of a design within acceptable constraints.

#### Examples
The following examples of requirements are taken from the TTL RFP:

![TTL Usability Requirement 1](https://togohogo1.github.io/Student-Engineer-Portfolio-and-Handbook/assets/handbook/ttl_req_1.png)

<sub><i>Figure 6.</i> Requirement taken from <a href="https://www.umcontario.com/about">[9]</a>. The high-level objective is usability.</sub>

7.2.3 contains the detailed objective, the metric, constraint, then criteria. Here are some key observations:
- "Should" is used in the constraint because of the tolerance in the constraint.
- The metric is quantifiable
- A justification is usually provided to explain why a requirement is important for the stakeholders.

Here is another requirement:

![TTL Usability Requirement 2](https://togohogo1.github.io/Student-Engineer-Portfolio-and-Handbook/assets/handbook/ttl_req_2.png)

<sub><i>Figure 7.</i> Requirement taken from <a href="https://www.umcontario.com/about">[9]</a></sub>

And some observations and conclusions:
- A requirement does not need a constraint when appropriate. In this case, finding the upper bound for cost was not a feasible task given our resources, but we intuitively knew that the criteria is "the less the better".
- It is possible that a criteria might be missing as well (usually when the metric is a yes/no)
- Objectives can have multiple metrics, which may influence number of criteria and constriants.

#### Visual Representation
A graphical format helps better visualize how requirements are connected with each other, stakeholders, etc:

![UMC Requirements](https://togohogo1.github.io/Student-Engineer-Portfolio-and-Handbook/assets/handbook/umc_req_pic.png)

<sub><i>Figure 8.</i> Graphical requirements taken from <a href="https://www.umcontario.com/about">[10]</a>. Our team commonly referenced it from time to time leading up to showcase.</sub>

## Diverging [ꜛ](#table-of-contents)
---
---
\
Put simply, diverging refers to the generation of ideas. How systematic diverging can be depends on the design space and diverging tool.

An important question to ask here is if "constraints limit creativity". [[11]](). To answer this question, a useful schematic to look at the notion of a design space is shown below.

![Design Space](https://togohogo1.github.io/Student-Engineer-Portfolio-and-Handbook/assets/handbook/design_space.png)

<sub><i>Figure 9.</i> Visualization adaptation of design space taken from <a href="https://www.umcontario.com/about">[11, slide 7]</a>. This is my favourite model representation in all of Praxis.</sub>

A scope defines multiple ways to approach an opportunity. The size of the smaller box in the opportunity space defines how broad or narrow the scope is. The solution space defines the potential solutions that could solve any possible scoped opportunity in the opportunity space. Finally, the design space is the solutions that may arise from the scoped opportunity. The magnitude of requirement constraints, determined by factors including materials, budge, time, etc. bounds the design space to a certain size.

This analogy turns divergence into an optimization problem. If the design space is too small, no ideas will come out. If it is too large, creative thought is limited. Some divergence tools inherently come with constraints, which may help or hinder finding the sweet spot of creative idea generation. [[11]]()

### Classical Brainstorming [ꜛ](#table-of-contents)
---
\
Classical brainstorming, or just brainstorming, is a popular diverging tool that most people are familiar with. There is usually no structure or restrictions to what can be during brainstorming. [[12, slide 11]]()

#### Features
There are a few things to keep in mind however: [[12, slide 11]]()
1. There should be no criticism for designs, even objectively bad ones.
2. Quantity over quality. The goal is to generate so many ideas that at least one is a good one.
3. Pay attention to the ideas of others and try to build off of them.
4. Avoid getting too caught up in an idea and spending too much time discussing it in detail.

#### Example and Takeaways
![Brainstorming](https://togohogo1.github.io/Student-Engineer-Portfolio-and-Handbook/assets/handbook/brainstorming.png)

<sub><i>Figure 10.</i> Classical brainstorming used by my team during 2 sessions: one from before Beta (left) and one after Beta (right)</sub>

I personally found classical brainstorming to be a great starting point. However, its fast pace and unstructured nature may not be the best way to generate more specific ideas. Despite its drawbacks, it was the most effective for my Praxis II team.

### Brainwriting 6-3-5 [ꜛ](#table-of-contents)
---
\
Brainwriting 6-3-5 is a more structured diverging tool emphasizing sketching instead of discussion, and it works best with a group. It supplements some of the drawbacks of brainstorming, namely uneven participation from group members. The process of executing Brainwriting 6-3-5 is outlined below: [[12, slide 8]]()

#### Features  [[12, slide 8]]()
1. Agree on a way to scope the opportunity
2. Prepare a collection of sticky notes or cue cards preferably
3. Distribute three stick notes to each person
4. Each person takes 5 minutes to come up with three possible ways of addressing the scoped opportunity with sketches and annotations
5. Pass the stick notes around the table (every passes to person sitting directly right or left)
6. THe next person builds on the idea of the current person, adds comments, or introduces new ideas
7. Repeat steps 5 and 6 until sufficient ideas have been generated
8. Discuss the ideas

#### My Experience
![Brainwriting](https://togohogo1.github.io/Student-Engineer-Portfolio-and-Handbook/assets/handbook/brainwriting.png)

<sub><i>Figure 11.</i> Final result of Brainwriting 6-3-5 during Praxis I diverging phase with my team. Click <a href="https://togohogo1.github.io/Student-Engineer-Portfolio-and-Handbook/assets/handbook/brainwriting.png">here</a> for a higher quality image.</sub>

My Praxis I team and I used this tool to come up with various mechanisms for an improvement to the desk-chairs in Sandford Fleming. Everyone built on everybody else's ideas exactly once, leaving 3 add-ons to each initial idea.

#### Takeaways
Brainwriting 6-3-5 was by far the most effective diverging tool for me. It generated the most ideas in the shorted amount of time, beating classical brainstorming. It was also exciting to see what my team members have been thinking, making this tool slightly more exciting.

### Lotus Blossom Technique [ꜛ](#table-of-contents)
---
\
The Lotus Blossom Technique works by defining a general central topic. Subtopics then "bloom" out of the general topic to become general topics of their own. This diverging tool focuses on bringing out the specifics of a general idea, due to the recursive process of subthemes becoming their own central themes [[13]](). This diverging tool works individually and with a group.

#### How to Use [[12, slide 15]]()
1. Create a 9 by 9 grid that's big enough to fit ideas in each cell
2. Write the central theme in the centermost cell
3. In the cells adjacent to it, generate up to 8 subtopics (they go in cells A to H)

    ![Lotus Level 1](https://togohogo1.github.io/Student-Engineer-Portfolio-and-Handbook/assets/handbook/lotus_lvl1.png)

4. Branch out. Put idea A in cell A', B in cell B' ... H in cell H'. These become the new subthemes.

    ![Lotus Level 2](https://togohogo1.github.io/Student-Engineer-Portfolio-and-Handbook/assets/handbook/lotus_lvl2.png)

5. For all the cells surrounding A', generate ideas that are related to A'. Do the same for B' all the way to H'.
6. It is not necessary to fill in the full diagram.
7. One can go as many levels as needed (but usually 2 is enough).
8. Discuss findings with the team, if available.

#### Example
![Praxis I Lotus Blossom](https://togohogo1.github.io/Student-Engineer-Portfolio-and-Handbook/assets/handbook/lotus_mine.png)

<sub><i>Figure 12.</i> Lotus Blossom done before Alpha for Praxis I. Each group member spent 30 minutes filling as much as they can before reconvening to discuss ideas</sub>

While my Praxis I teammates claimed that the Lotus Blossom was nothing more than a reorganization of ideas (I agree to a certain extent), it lead me to more detailed research for various features that could be implemented in the Sandford Fleming desk-chair.

#### Takeaways
Lotus Blossom encourages focused, individual diverging. It fully allows for individual values and biases to be conveyed. Unlike Brainwriting 6-3-5 and classical brainstorming. Ideas generated are not influenced by others. Lotus Blossom is not as effective if one tries to fill out all of the cells especially used as a second round diverging tool, due to idea repetition.

### Morph Charts & SCAMPER [ꜛ](#table-of-contents)
---
\
Morphological (Morph) Charts are divergence tools that are incredibly useful when doing feature divergence. Morph charts often require a high-level concept, and the different mechanisms that may be part of that concept are listed and compared with one another.

#### How it Works
1. Set up a table. Thw rows represent the aspects of the concept and the columns represent approaches to each aspect.
2. Come up with approaches for each aspect. This is where research and reference designs may come in handy.
3. Explore different combinations of aspects to see which ones work the best.

#### SCAMPER
Enter SCAMPER, a subtool that works best with a Morph Chart. SCAMPER considers what a design needs to accomplish as a whole [[14]]() instead of individual components. SCAMPER is an acronym for:
- **S**ubstitute
- **C**ombine
- **A**dapt
- **M**odify
- **P**ut to other purposes
- **E**liminate
- **R**everse/Rearrange

Which means a systematic way of finding the right combination to best suit the opportunity. I will not go into too much detail about SCAMPER because it was not effective for me in Praxis I and Praxis II. I think it is because the optimal combination has been identified in Morph Charts by inspection without the need to go through a long process.

#### Example and Takeaways
![Praxis II Morph Chart](https://togohogo1.github.io/Student-Engineer-Portfolio-and-Handbook/assets/handbook/morph_chart.png)

<sub><i>Figure 12.</i> Morph chart for Praxis II. Boxed approach was the one that lead us towards our final Showcase concept.</sub>

The Morph Chart is incredibly usefl when doing feature divergence. However, mixing and matching to generate a "best of all approaches" concept will not always work. Otherwise its possible to end up like the ZTE Hawkeye [[15]](https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/2/17/14647990/zte-hawkeye-phone-kickstarter-campaign-end) phone.

The more important takeaway from the Morph Chart would be the quality of research I enact and how detailed I specify about a concept to learn more about it.

## Converging [ꜛ](#table-of-contents)
---
---
\
Converging is concerned with the decision-making process - throwing ideas away after a round of divergence through formal and informal techniques. [[16]](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/365313393_Metaphors_To_Design_By_Developing_Representations_of_Engineering_Design)

Since engineering design is iterative, multiple rounds of diverging and converging (and if necessary, framing) can happen multiple times, continually shrinking and expanding the solution pool until a final solution is reached.

The following sections introduces two converging tools that are often used sequentially.
<script src="https://cdn.mathjax.org/mathjax/latest/MathJax.js?config=TeX-AMS-MML_HTMLorMML" type="text/javascript"></script>

### Pairwise Comparison Matrix [ꜛ](#table-of-contents)
---
\
This converging tool is quite basic. It allows for every design to be compared against each other. Suppose there are $$n$$ designs. Then the total comparisons would be $$ \frac{n(n-1)}{2} \approx \frac{n^2}{2}$$. These comparisons are usually made quickly without much evidence to back up how one design is better than another.
