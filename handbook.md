This handbook contains over 15 tools, models, and frameworks (TMFs) that I have used. Consequently, these tools are selected based on my positionality and most of them have proven to work, and will likely continue reinforcing my engineering journey ahead.

The following TMFs will be listed in a somewhat logical order to use them, each accompanied by a sufficient description and usage examples.

As a reminder to myself and also for the sake of being concise, I will define certain terms I reference multiple times in this Handbook.

    <tr>
        <td>
        Alpha Release (<b>Alpha</b>)
        </td>
        <td>
        A team communication and discussion assessment where course instructors assess an intermediate step of the final Design Report for Praxis I.
        </td>

    <tr>
        <td>
        <b>Design Report</b>
        </td>
        <td>
        A document that frames an engineering opportunity within the University and recommends a solution. Our design report focused on improving the desk-charis in Sandford Fleming, which an emphasis on left-handed users. Done as part of Praxis I

    <tr>
        <td>
        Request for Proposal (<b>RFP</b>)
        </td>
        <td>
        A document that offers engineering services and frames an engineering opportunity to be solved. The two RFPs we worked on include:
        <ul>
            <li><b>TTL RFP</b>: An RFP for the <a href="https://www.torontotoollibrary.com/">Toronto Tool Library</a> (TTL), written by my Praxis II team to improve the productivity of TTL's tool check-in and check-out system.</li>
            <li><b>UMC RFP</b>: An RFP for the <a href="https://www.umcontario.com/">Ukrainian Museum of Canada</a> (UMC), written by another Praxis II team to address the need for in-gallery textile storage. We were assigned to work on this RFP for Showcase.</li>
        </ul>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Beta Release (<b>Beta</b>)</td>
        <td>The Praxis II version of Alpha Release with higher expectations and an emphasis on verification and validation.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Showcase</b></td>
        <td>The culminating oral evaluation of Praxis II where we show our term-long design work addressing the opportunity regarding the UMC RFP.</td>

## Foundational Concepts [ꜛ](#table-of-contents)

\
This section contains various TMFs that sets up the prior knowledge that is useful for Framing, Diverging, Converging, and Representing (FDCR). The next sections give a more detailed breakdown of FDCR but for now, it suffices to know that it is a way to model engineering design that naturally repeats itself.

### The Perry Model of Intellectual and Ethical Development [ꜛ](#table-of-contents)
---
<br>

#### Introduction
The Perry Model is a representation of attitudes one can experience when embarking on an engineering journey. To gain a better understanding, consider the following terms:
1. **A**uthority: Emphasis on the capital **A**, relates to making decisions based on consultations with someone knowledgeable.
2. **a**uthority: Emphasis on the lowercase **a**, relates to the recognition that one can make their own decisions with the facility of a higher **A**uthority.

For student engineers, the goal of the Perry Model is to show the possibility of transitioning from Authority to authority.
