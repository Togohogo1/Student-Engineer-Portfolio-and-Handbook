title: Student Engineer Portfolio and Handbook
---
Welcome!

I am Kevin Wang, a first-year Engineering Science student and aspiring engineer. This website was crafted to highlight my engineering journey since September of 2022. I shall reflect on what useful impact my engineering experiences can make to guide my personal and professional career.

This document is split into two parts. [The Design Portfolio](https://togohogo1.github.io/Student-Engineer-Portfolio-and-Handbook/portfolio/) is where I explain my engineering identity, how I engage in engineering design, and an overview of my design work. [The Handbook](https://togohogo1.github.io/Student-Engineer-Portfolio-and-Handbook/handbook/) is a repository of different tools, models, and frameworks used in engineering.
