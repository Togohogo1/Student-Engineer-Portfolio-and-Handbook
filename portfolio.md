## What to Expect [ꜛ](#table-of-contents)
The purpose of the Design Portfolio is to present the following:
- Introduce my interpretations and beliefs of "Engineering", "Design", and "Engineering Design"
- Explain how my position in context as a student engineer changed over the course of Praxis II
- Evaluate my strengths and weaknesses as part of my position in context
- Consider personal and external biases
- Highlight my design projects in a visually appealing manner and relate them back to my position in context

## Engineering, Design, and Engineering Design [ꜛ](#table-of-contents)
Loosely defined, engineering is "the application of science to the optimum conversion of the resources of nature to the uses of humankind" [[1]](https://www.britannica.com/technology/engineering). Based on my experiences, I think engineering is a lot more nuanced.

<sup><i>Figure 1.</i> Engineering, Design, and Engineering Design group discussion activity from one of the first Praxis II studios </sup>

Im the image above, I formulated some new definitions:
- **Engineering**: Applied scientific theory, principles, and research with societal considerations
- **Design**: Manifestation of ideas
- **Engineering Design**, having the following properties:
    1. Intent for design to serve a purpose
    2. Follows some process or framework
    3. Follows underlying theory / principles / standards / research

Having finished Praxis II, the work I have done conforms well to my definition of engineering design with a small modification given more stakeholder interaction opportunities.
- 3\. Follows underlying  theory / principles / standards / research / **human preference**

I chose to start my Design Portfolio with this section because it serves as a basis for everything that follows, given that "engineering design" is mentioned a lot. Additionally, this section indirectly offers my values and perspectives. The next section does exactly that, but in a direct appraoch.

## Position in Context and My Design Process [ꜛ](#table-of-contents)
Also referred to as "positionality", Position in Context is defined as:
- Engagement in engineering design with respect to how I interpret the world around me, and how these interpreations shape my beliefs. [[2]]()

### Values [ꜛ](#table-of-contents)
As part of my original Position Statement, an assignment that asks engineering students to comment on their positionality, I mentioned the following:

<table>
    <!-- <tr>
    <th>Person 1</th>
    <th>Person 2</th>
    <th>Person 3</th>
    </tr> -->
    <tr>
        <td>
            I used the word <b>"methodology"</b> to summarize my work
        </td>
        <td>
            I prefer to:
                <ul>
                <li>Order steps in an outline</li>
                <li>Be pedantic about certainby before moving ahead</li>
                <li>Know exactly where to find what I need</li>
                </ul>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            I tend to think more <b>mathematically</b> and <b>abstractly</b>
        </td>
        <td>
            <ul>
            <li>I prefer to perform mathematical calculations and derivations</li>
            <li>I like to tinker with electronics, code, and CAD software</li>
            <li>I do acknowledge that abstract thinking is sometimes necessary</li>
            </ul>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>
