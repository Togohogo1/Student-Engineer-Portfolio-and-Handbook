## What to Expect [ꜛ](#table-of-contents)
---
---
\
The purpose of the Design Portfolio is to present the following:
- Introduce my interpretations and beliefs of "Engineering", "Design", and "Engineering Design"
- Explain how my position in context as a student engineer changed over the course of Praxis II
- Evaluate my strengths and weaknesses as part of my position in context
- Consider personal and external biases
- Highlight my design projects in a visually appealing manner and relate them back to my position in context

## Engineering, Design, and Engineering Design [ꜛ](#table-of-contents)

\
Loosely defined, engineering is "the application of science to the optimum conversion of the resources of nature to the uses of humankind" [[1]](https://www.britannica.com/technology/engineering). Based on my experiences, I think engineering is a lot more nuanced.

<sup><i>Figure 1.</i> Engineering, Design, and Engineering Design group discussion activity from one of the first Praxis II studios </sup>

Im the image above, I formulated some new definitions:
- **Engineering**: Applied scientific theory, principles, and research with societal considerations
- **Design**: Manifestation of ideas
- **Engineering Design**, having the following properties:
    1. Intent for design to serve a purpose
    2. Follows some process or framework
    3. Follows underlying theory / principles / standards / research

Having finished Praxis II, the work I have done conforms well to my definition of engineering design with a small modification given more stakeholder interaction opportunities.
- 3\. Follows underlying  theory / principles / standards / research / **human preference**

I chose to start my Design Portfolio with this section because it serves as a basis for everything that follows, given that "engineering design" is mentioned a lot. Additionally, this section indirectly offers my values and perspectives. The next section does exactly that, but in a direct appraoch.

## Position in Context and My Design Process [ꜛ](#table-of-contents)
---
---
\
Also referred to as "positionality", Position in Context is defined as:
- Engagement in engineering design with respect to how I interpret the world around me, and how these interpreations shape my beliefs. [[2]]()

### Values [ꜛ](#table-of-contents)
---
\
As part of my original Position Statement, an assignment that asks engineering students to comment on their positionality, I mentioned the following:

<table>
    <!-- <tr>
    <th>Person 1</th>
    <th>Person 2</th>
    <th>Person 3</th>
    </tr> -->
    <tr>
        <td>
            I used the word <b>"methodology"</b> to summarize my work
        </td>
        <td>
            <ul>
            <li>I prefer to order steps in an outline</li>
            <li>I like to be pedantic about certainby before moving ahead</li>
            <li>I want to Know exactly where to find what I need</li>
            </ul>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            I tended to think more <b>mathematically</b> and <b>abstractly</b>
        </td>
        <td>
            <ul>
            <li>I prefer to perform mathematical calculations and derivations</li>
            <li>I like to tinker with electronics, code, and CAD software</li>
            <li>I do acknowledge that abstract thinking is sometimes necessary</li>
            </ul>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            I believed that the <b>social aspects</b> of engineering are just as important as the scientific aspects
        </td>
        <td>
            <ul>
            <li>
            Communication between parties is crucial to circulate ideas and feedback
            </li>
            </ul>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            I emphasized the importance of a <b>hands-on approach</b>
        </td>
        <td>
            <ul>
            <li>
            I believe the best way to learn and bring an idea to life is to physically design it
            </li>
            </ul>
        </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>
            I supported the idea of <b>continuous drafting</b> and <b>iterating</b>
        </td>
        <td>
            <ul>
            <li>It is not possible to reach perfection but perfectly possible to approach perfection</li>
            <li>Perfection is not approachable in one step</li>
            </ul>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>

I came into Praxis II with these values, so it is inevitable that I would conform to them at the beginning. In fact, most activities in Praxis II reinforced these values, such as working on tech components of prototyping to verification with stakeholders.

However, there is one major change - to be more open about flexibility. Sometimes I need to let go of certain things and be a bit impulsive with what is currently available. Ultimately, there is no tradeoff between spending more time than necessary and getting minimal return on investment, but to know if I crossed that limit is hard to determine.

Once in a while, it is worth it to take a risk, prepare for the worst, and hope for the best. I have learned that not everything in Praxis II was as certain as Praxis I (like finding a community for the Community Profile assignment), and this is something I will have to accept moving forward as an aspiring engineer. With that in mind:
<table>
    <tr>
        <td><b>Not</b> everything in engineering design will be <b>certain</b></td>
        <td>
            <ul>
            <li>
            It is fully in my power to try to mitigate these uncertainties
            </li>
            </ul>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>


### Abilities [ꜛ](#table-of-contents)
---
\
This section focuses more on the technological aspects of my skill set, more commonly known as "hard skills". Images of these skills can be found in [Design Experiences](#design-experiences-ꜛ):

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Skill</th>
        <th>Details</th>
    </tr>
        <td>Programming</td>
        <td>I am fluent in Python, having worked with various data-science related libraries for clubs and personal projects. I applied my programming intuition for the CIV102 bridge and used my OpenCV skills for Praxis II</td>
    <tr>
        <td>Computer Aided Design (CAD)</td>
        <td>Having CADed for Praxis I and the CIV102 bridge, I was easily able to apply and elevate these skills in Praxis II with more advanced CAD models</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Building/Crafting</td>
        <td>With an artistic background, I believe I have a knack for physical design. The quality of my builds are reflected through their appearances</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Research</td>
        <td>I did not know how much I enjoyed doing research prior to September 2022. I consistently found appropriate standards, handbooks, journal articles for requirements and proxy tests</td>
    </tr>
</table>

### Strengths [ꜛ](#table-of-contents)
---
\
I defined a "strength" to capture the behaviourl aspects of my skill set, more commonly known as "soft skills".
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Strength</th>
        <th>Details</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Adaptability</td>
        <td>I know that I am stronger in some areas than others, but I realized through Praxis II I could take on any task from engineering writing to verbal communication. I became more confident in my well-roundedness.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Drive</td>
        <td>I have high standards for myself and I am willing to put in the effort to achieve those standards. I like to push myself to see what I am capable of. I promised myself to make the most out of my Praxis II experience.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Attention to Detail</td>
        <td>I emphasize the importance of following a consistent format from document headings to folder structures. I expect form, order, and function with my designs. Every small detail counts. </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Leadership</td>
        <td>I was slightly uncertain with this one because I never considered myself a natural leader. However, Praxis II taught me that when necessary, I aim to facilitate the direction of group discussions, define deadlines to keep the team ahead of schedule, and keep team members accountable</td>
    </tr>
</table>

### Biases [ꜛ](#table-of-contents)
---
\
While writing the Design Portfolio and the Handbook, I identified two major sources of bias that should be acknowledged:
<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Bias</th>
        <th>Type</th>
        <th>Prevention</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td></td>
    </tr>
    <tr></tr>
</table>
