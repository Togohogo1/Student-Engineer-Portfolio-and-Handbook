## What to Expect [ꜛ](#table-of-contents)
The purpose of the Design Portfolio is to present the following:
- Introduce my interpretations and beliefs of "Engineering", "Design", and "Engineering Design"
- Explain how my position in context as a student engineer changed over the course of Praxis II
- Evaluate my strengths and weaknesses as part of my position in context
- Consider personal and external biases
- Highlight my design projects in a visually appealing manner and relate them back to my position in context

## Engineering, Design, and Engineering Design [ꜛ](#table-of-contents)
Loosely defined, engineering is "the application of science to the optimum conversion of the resources of nature to the uses of humankind" [[1]](https://www.britannica.com/technology/engineering). Based on my experiences, I think engineering is a lot more nuanced.
