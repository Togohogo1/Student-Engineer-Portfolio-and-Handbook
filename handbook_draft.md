## Where to find evidence

### Praxis I:
- Raw images in the discord channel
- Bulk of information found in "PRAXIS I 2022"
- Cad models in fusion 360 workspace
- "DESIGN-BRIEF-PRAXIS-I" word doc shared by teammate
- "DESIGN-REPORT-PRAXIS-I" word doc located in my onedrive
- Remaining images are littered across my phone

### CIV Bridge:
- MATLAB code is on the cloud and also in my github
- Cad models, engineering drawings in fusion 360 workspace
- Final design word doc shared by teammate
- Editable docs found on google drive
- Submitted pdfs local on my system and on
- Raw images of construction process are stored on my phone

### Praxis II:
- Raw images littered in general channel and pics or it didn't happen
- Most information during the first phase found in notion page
- Bulk of information found in PRAXIS II
- Remaining images are littered across my phone
- Beta CAD model on teammate's device
- All code written on github

# Part I: The Design Portfolio

## Engineering, Design, and Engineering Design

## Position in Context
### Values
- I tend to put lots of emphasis on consistency, especially with formatting, neatness, and minimalism. I made sure that my attention to detail is conveyed through the format in which I present this handbook in a neat and concise manner. ~~if i decide to use MD instead write: This handbook can be conveyed through a neat and simple manner ...~~
- I like tech. I try to include a technical aspect whenver possible when tackling a design solution. This is reflected in the tools I used to create the handbook.

### Abilities

### Strengths

### Biases
It is importnat several areas of bias I am subjected to including influence from this assignment and also influence from my values:
1. (handbook bias) This handbook is worth marks. I understand that project constraints will limit exactly what should be put in this handbook.
    - I'm desining this handbook as "one place for all" where I can refer to in the future, so I have to make is as comprehensive as possible either way. If I am able to do that, then the marks will come naturally.

### Areas for Improvement
I was surprised to learn that one of the most valuable takeaways from my engineering design experience was what I learnt about myself. Part of these experiences was learning what my weaknesses were and my plans to account for them in the future.

## Design Experiences

## Questions
- Can we split Praxis I and II into 2 parts - alpha & design report, beta & showcase
- Must the design experiences be one slide only [1], means I will only have a minimum of 3 slides if super restrictive [2], am I allowed to elaborate further down after a 1 paged summary [3] or does this elaboration happen during the handbook part [4]
- Assume the most restrictive, then wouldn't the "Porfolio" be more a personal statement? seems disporportionate

# Part II: The Handbook

## Introduction
### Definitions?
## Framing
## Diverging
## Converging
## Representing
## Questions
- Do we need evidence for every tool that we use
- Would a single diverging tool like Lotus Blossom count as a single TMF out of the 20 max
