# Student-Engineer-Portfolio-and-Handbook
Engineering handbook detailing all the engineering principles I learnt from ESC101 and ESC102

`bundle exec jekyll serve`

### Todo
- Underline `####` type headers
- If needed, figure out how to not make references wrap properly
- Think about including the showcase poster and one pager
- Hyperlink links in bib
- Read over the whole thing out loud
- link 4 in handbook messed up indexing
- fix up all references (messed up fr)
- redo references
- refactor the one pagers
