# Student-Engineer-Portfolio-and-Handbook
Engineering handbook detailing all the engineering principles I learnt from ESC101 and ESC102

`bundle exec jekyll serve`

### Todo
- Underline `####` type headers
- If needed, figure out how to not make references wrap properly
- Think about including the showcase poster and one pager
- Hyperlink links in bib
- Read over the whole thing out loud
- link 4 in handbook messed up indexing
- fix up all references (messed up fr)
- redo references
- refactor the one pagers

- create a git branch based on the submitted commit? (read up and confirm https://github.com/orgs/community/discussions/21582 and https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/configuring-a-publishing-source-for-your-github-pages-site)
- add a paragraph on where to find the original files
- add a time and a date when mark got released, moratorium, when my assignment got graded
- merge gh-pages to main and set that as the publishing source or research on how to set gh-pages as "main"

remember: let this be my "design portfolio" i kinda promised to create
